## How to Play
One player will host the game, while the others will join the host by entering the host's IP address. (Up to 4 players including the host.)

After the host has selected a map, and all players have selected their teams, the host starts the game to begin the match.

### Dealthmatch Mode
Players fire at each other and use various powerups to destroy tanks on other teams until only one team remains. Last team remianing wins.

### Highscore Mode
