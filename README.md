## How to Play
One player will host the game, while the others will join the host by entering the host's IP address. (Up to 4 players including the host.)

After the host has selected a map, and all players have selected their teams, the host starts the game to begin the match.

### Dealthmatch Mode
Players fire at each other and use various powerups to destroy tanks on other teams until only one team remains. Last team remianing wins.

### Highscore Mode

### Controls

- A, D: Rotate the tank left or right

If the player has any powerups in their inventory, the following controls will utilize them:
- 1: Use health pack. (Restores some health)
- 2: Place down mine. (Directly below tank.)
- 3: Use speed boost pack. (Wears off over time.)
- 4: Use armor boost pack. (Wears off over time.)
- 5: Use invincibility pack. (Wears off over time.)
- 6: Use beer. (Temp invincibility. Wears off over time, afterwards player experiences "hangover" which negatively effects armor and speed.)
